## highest-weight-path
Find the highest weight path through a directed acyclic path. Can be constrained or unconstrained

An example input DAG is shown in dag.txt. The tab delimited format is as follows:

All vertices are printed first, with one line per vertex. Fields:
v
vertex name

All edges are printed second, with fields:
e
edge name
start vertex
end vertex
weight

The file "printEditGraph.py" will print the alignment edit graph for two genomic sequences, which can then be input in to print_highest_weight_path.py. The sequences are hard-coded in as an example, but this is easily changed.
